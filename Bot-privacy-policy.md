1. Data Collection and Usage
face_auth collects images of the user's face solely for the purpose of verifying identity and registering attendance. This process is essential for the core functionality of the app.

Images: Facial images are captured directly through the app's camera function. These images are used exclusively for:

Identity Verification: To confirm the user's identity against a pre-registered profile.

Attendance Registration: To record the user's presence at a specific time and location.

Location Data (Optional/If Applicable): If your app uses location data for attendance (e.g., to confirm the user is at a specific work site), you MUST include this. Otherwise, delete this section.

"If enabled by the user, face_auth may collect precise location data to verify attendance at designated locations. This data is used solely for the purpose of confirming the user's physical presence for attendance tracking."

Other Data: No other personal identifying information (e.g., name, email, phone number) is collected directly by the app during the face capture process, beyond what's necessary for the attendance system you integrate with. Any such information would be handled by the backend system your app integrates with.

2. Data Storage and Security
Image Storage: Facial images are processed and stored [briefly explain where they are processed/stored, e.g., "securely on our servers," or "locally on the device only for processing and then discarded," or "sent to [Integrate with Third-Party Service Name] for processing"].

Crucial: Be specific here. If images are uploaded to a server, clearly state this. If they're processed on-device and then deleted, state that.

Security Measures: We implement industry-standard security measures to protect the data collected, including encryption during transmission and at rest, and access controls to prevent unauthorized access.

Data Retention: Facial images and associated attendance records are retained for [state your data retention policy, e.g., "the duration of the user's active account," or "as long as necessary for attendance auditing purposes," or "deleted after [X] days/months"].

3. Data Sharing
No Sale of Data: We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data, including facial images, to third parties.

Third-Party Services (If Applicable): If your app integrates with a third-party attendance management system or facial recognition API, you MUST disclose it here. Otherwise, delete this section.

"Facial image data is transmitted to [Name of Third-Party Service, e.g., 'our integrated attendance management system, XZ Corp.'] for processing and verification. This third-party service is contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the purposes of attendance verification."

Link to Third-Party Privacy Policy (Crucial): "You can review their privacy policy at [Link to Third-Party Privacy Policy]."

Legal Compliance: We may disclose your data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency).

4. User Consent and Control
Camera Access: The app requires access to the device's camera to function. Users will be prompted for camera access permissions upon first use. The app cannot function without this permission.

Image Review (Optional/If Applicable): If users can review or delete their captured images within the app, mention it here.
